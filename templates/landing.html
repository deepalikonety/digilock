                The options provided cater to distinct authentication methods for accessing documents within the system. "Normal Access" allows users to upload documents securely solely by employing a secret key, ensuring straightforward and efficient document management. Conversely, "Face Access" employs a more sophisticated authentication approach, requiring users to undergo facial recognition for access, thus bolstering security measures by incorporating biometric authentication into the process. These options afford users the flexibility to choose between simplicity and advanced security measures, catering to diverse user needs and preferences within the document management system
